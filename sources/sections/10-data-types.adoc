=== Contribution Element Metadata

In addition to the Basic Data Values, the _BasicDocument_ model defines a container encoding the contribution made by a party towards a particular element in the document, with the following attributes:

`dateTime`:: The date and time when the contribution was made.
`contributor`:: The party who made the contribution, as described through the `contributor` element in <<relaton>>.
`inegrityValue`:: A digital signature of the contribution, consisting of a `hash` value and a `signature`, with an associated `publicKey`.

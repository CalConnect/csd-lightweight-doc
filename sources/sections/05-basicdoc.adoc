== BasicDocument model

The _BasicDocument_ model treats all documents as collections of _sections_ (<<basicsection>>). It also adds the following metadata as part of the document model:

// Please confirm what I've assumed here for identifier
// TODO: I'm surprised it's mandatory: that certainly is not the case for Metanorma!

`identifier`:: a globally unique identifier for the document in an agreed identifier schema. The identifier is to be used for tracking interactions with the document without depending on formal document registries; it would be exemplified by a GUID, rather than a document registry identifier such as "`ISO 639`", which belongs to `bibdata`.

`bibdata`:: a bibliographic description, capturing bibliographic metadata about the document itself, including authors, title, and date of production.

`integrityValue`:: an optional digital signature of the document (<<contributionelementmetadata>>).

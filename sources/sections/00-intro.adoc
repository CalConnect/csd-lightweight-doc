== Introduction

There is a general need for interchange and interoperability of
structured text amongst information systems.

While there is a plethora of richly-formatted  text documents,
ranging from complex document formats like OOXML and ODF, hypertext
formats like HTML, to older formats such as RTF and
presentation-focused formats like PDF,
there is no standardized method of transmitting an interoperable
text structure to another system.

In addition, the popularity of lightweight text markup syntaxes
such as Markdown and AsciiDoc has been hampered by practical concerns
that documents generated by such syntaxes have inherited identical
issues as have the document formats described above.

Such issues have limited the exchange of structured text down to
the lowest common denominator in parsing support, which is
plain text, with no defined human- or machine-understandable
structure.

The _BasicDocument_ model is created to express the structure of
generic documents in a lightweight form.

_BasicDocument_ achieves a number of goals:

* Serve as an interoperable basis that allows systems to interchange
  general documents while preserving semantics;
* Allows document formats to be mapped to it and out of it, effectively
  enabling document formats to be converted to presentation
  formats without loss of meaning;
* Establishes a central data model for supporting multiple input
  formats (and syntaxes) with multiple output formats; and
* Enables changes to be applied incrementally in a defined manner.

_BasicDocument_ is deliberately not a detailed document model,
unlike DocBook and TEI: it is intended to be a base document model
which other document models can map to or specialize upon.

The _BasicDocument_ document model has been designed to
maintain compatibility with several existing models, with
a view to reflecting the expressiveness of existing document
structures, but also to align with the capability of
established document production tools.

The markup languages and document production tools that
_BasicDocument_ sought to align with include:

* hypertext formats: W3C HTML 5 and HTML 4
* document formats: OOXML, Microsoft RTF, DocBook
* text markup syntaxes: Markdown and AsciiDoc

//The modelling of blocks and inline elements in particular are closely aligned with HTML.

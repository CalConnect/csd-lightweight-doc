== Change models

=== General

The change models are provided in _BasicDocument_ to enable changes to be
applied incrementally towards a _BasicDocument_ in a defined manner.


.Basic Document model: Changes
image::basicdoc-models/images/Change.png[]


=== Change

The _Change_ model defines an action to be performed on an element within _BasicDocument_.

It contains the following attributes:

`target`::  The element that this action should be applied to.
`identifier`::  A unique identifier of this change.
`parentIdentifier`::  One or more unique identifiers of _Change_ objects, that this change is supposed to follow after.
`contribMetadata`::  Metadata of the contributor, see <<contributionelementmetadata>>.


=== Change set

The _ChangeSet_ model defines a collection of _Change_ data, and specifies
a unique identifier that identifies the _BasicDocument_ where this
_ChangeSet_ should be applied to.

`changes`:: The set of _Change_ data.
`documentIdentifier`:: The unique identifier that identifies the _BasicDocument_
where this _ChangeSet_ should be applied to.


=== Unique identifier

The unique identifier is used to uniquely identify a _BasicDocument_.

It contains the attribute:

`value`:: A string that uniquely identifies a _BasicDocument_.


=== Content change

==== General

The _ContentChange_ model defines possible actions
that involve modification of content within a _BasicDocument_
data element.

==== Content change action

The _ContentChangeAction_ model is used to indicate the actual content
changes that applies to the specified portion of textual content.
This is used both by the _ContentModify_ and _AttributeModify_ models
as their content are treated as pure text.

It provides the following attributes:

`action`:: A _ContentAction_ value, where it could be either `insert` or `delete`,
  indicating text to be inserted or deleted from the content.

`from`:: An `Integer` that specifies the beginning cursor position of a textual change.
`to`:: An `Integer` that specifies the ending cursor position of a textual change.
`text`:: In the case of an `insert`, a `String` to be inserted or replace the substring referred to by `from` to `to`.
`length`:: In the case of a `delete`, an `Integer` to indicate how many characters to be removed from the `from` position.
  In the case of an `insert`, an `Integer` to indicate the length of the `text` attribute.


==== Content modify

The _ContentModify_ class provides a container for a multiple _ContentChangeAction_ data.

It has the following attribute:

`actions`:: One or more `ContentChangeAction` data


=== Attribute change


The _AttributeChange_ model defines possible actions
that involve modification of an attribute within a _BasicDocument_
data element.

==== Attribute change action

Similar to _ContentChangeAction_ which it inherits from,
the _AttributeChangeAction_ class is used to specify an
actual change to an attribute.

It has the following attribute:

`attributeId`:: A `String` that identifies the attribute where the attribute change
should apply to.


==== Attribute modify

The _AttributeModify_ class provides a container for a multiple _AttributeChangeAction_ data.

It has the following attribute:

`actions`:: One or more `AttributeChangeAction` data

// TODO: This seems to only handle a string, not changing attribute name or attribute value?!


=== Node change

==== General

The _NodeChange_ model defines possible actions that involve
modification of data elements at the node level within a
_BasicDocument_.

The `target` attribute inherited from the _Change_ model indicates
the node this _NodeChange_ action applies to.


==== Node insert

The _NodeInsert_ class specifies the insertion
of a data node in a _BasicDocument_.

It has the following attribute:

`content`:: A data element conforming to _BasicElement_ to be inserted into the specified _BasicDocument_.


==== Node delete

The _NodeDelete_ class specifies the deletion of a data node in a _BasicDocument_.

It has the following attributes:

`hashValue`:: An optional string that contains the hash value of the node to be deleted for verification purposes.


==== Node move

The _NodeMove_ class specifies moving of a particular node in a _BasicDocument_
to another location within the same _BasicDocument_.

It has the following attributes:

`positionOld`:: A `ReferenceToIdElement` that indicates the position of the node's parent.
  While this seems redundant to the `target` attribute inherited from the _Change_ model,
  it is useful for verifying that the location has not changed.

`positionNew`:: A `ReferenceToIdElement` that indicates the new parent or sibling of the node.

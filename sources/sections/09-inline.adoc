== Inline element models

=== General

Inline elements represent the components of text blocks. They are modelled in the _BasicDocument_ model as _Basic Elements_.

All Basic Elements have the following attribute:

`contributionelementmetadata`:: attribution of the element to a specific contributor (<<contributionelementmetadata>>), to be used in change management of documents.

Three subclasses of Basic Elements are modelled:

* Text elements, which contain text and associated formatting information, but which do not contain any associated identifiers. (<<textelements>>)
* ID elements, which contain identifiers. (<<image>>)
* Reference elements, which contain references to identifiers. (<<crossreferences>>)

Footnotes (<<footnote>>) are a special case of Reference element, which are not included under Basic Elements because of the need to exclude them from certain classes of paragraph (<<basicpara>>).

[[textelements]]
=== Text Elements

The modelling of text elements is substantially derived from HTML, and encompasses semantically significant formatting of text. For example, it encompasses italics and boldface (under their semantic guise of `emphasis` and `strong`); but it omits different sizes of font, as information that is typically semantically predictable, and relegated to stylesheets.

All text elements contain a localised string (<<datavalues>>).

The following elements indicate formatting, and have no further attributes:

* Monospace (corresponding to HTML `tt`, `code`)
* Keyword
* Emphasis (corresponding to HTML `em`, `i`)
* Strong (corresponding to HTML `strong`, `b`)
* Superscript (corresponding to HTML `sup`)
* Subscript (corresponding to HTML `sub`)
* Strike (corresponding to HTML 4 `s`)
* Small Caps

Text Elements also include the STEM element, representing mathematical and other formulas. This consists of a `type`, indicating which language is used to express the formula, and the content of the formula itself. By default the _BasicDocument_ model allows AsciiMath and MathML in STEM elements.

=== Empty Elements

The following elements are subclasses of Basic Element that contain no text, and are intended to represent semantically significant formatting elements:

* Line Break (corresponding to HTML `br`)
* Page Break
* Horizontal Rule (corresponding to HTML `hr`)

=== ID Elements

ID Elements are inline elements that have an identifier (`id`), which permits them to be cross-referenced by Reference Elements (<<crossreferences>>). ID Elements in the _BasicDocument_ model do not contain text.

There are two subclasses of ID Elements in the _BasicDocument_ model:

* _Bookmarks_ are intended as anchors for cross-references which do not have scope over blocks or sections. Anchors within a block under the _BasicDocument_ model cannot span across a number of inline elements; bookmarks are intended as point anchors. For that reason, the Review block (<<review>>) has a starting reference and an optional ending reference, which can be bookmarks as well as block or section references.

* _Images_ are containers for pictorial content. They have the following attribues:

`source`:: indicating the URI of the image file

`filename`:: indicating a file name corresponding to the image, to which the image can be extracted if it is represented inline (e.g. in Base64 encoding in the URI)

`type`:: indicating the type of the image file; the Basic Document model constraints this to be one of `SVG`, `JPEG`, `GIF`, `PNG`, `PDF`.
// TODO: This ought to be relaxed

`alt`:: alternate text, supplied for accessibility
`height`:: optional attribute, which can be an integer or "auto"
`width`:: optional attribute, which can be an integer or "auto"

NOTE: The _BasicDocument_ model does not encompass audio and video files, but any extensions to the model would treat them likewise as ID Elements.

[[crossreferences]]
=== Reference Elements

Reference Elements are inline elements which reference other elements in the document, or other documents. All Reference Elements are modelled as containing the following attributes:

`text`:: The optional, unformatted textual content of the reference element.
`type`:: The type of Reference Element, prescribing how it is to be rendered. The _BasicDocument_ model recognises four types: _inline_ (referencing another element in the same document), _external_ (referencing an external document), _footnote_ (an inline reference to be rendered as a footnote), and _callout_ (an inline reference to be rendered as a callout: <<basicsourcecode>>).

The following subclasses of Reference Elements are modelled.

* Reference to Link Element: An external reference, whose `target` is defined as a URI. An optional `alt` attribute is also permitted, summarising the link content for accessibility.
* Reference to Citation Element: An external reference to a bibliographic entity, as modelled in <<relaton>> as a _citation_. In addition to the attributes of _citation_, the reference has an optional `normative` attribute (which may be used by those standards which differentiate normative and informative references), and optional `citeAs` attributes prescribing how the bibliographic citation should be rendered in the text.
* Reference to ID Element: An internal reference, whose `target` corresponds to the identifier of a section, block or ID Element within the current document.

The Reference to ID Element class in turn has the following subclasses modelled:

* Callout, for which the `type` is set to _callout_, and the `text` is constrained to be a single mandatory string. The target of the callout is understood to be the location of the callout within the source code; the extent of the target is not expressed overtly.
* Reference To ID With Paragraph Element, which associates both `text` and `content` to the cross-reference; the `content` is a sequence of one or more paragraphs (<<basicpara>>).

[[footnote]]
=== Footnote

Footnotes are modelled as a subclass of Reference To ID With Paragraph Element, which constrain their `type` to be _footnote_. The `text` attribute is the footnote reference, and the `content` attribute is the footnote contents.  The target of the footnote is understood to be the location of the footnote within the text; the extent of the target is not expressed overtly.

NOTE: Endnotes are not modelled separately from footnotes in the _BasicDocument_ model, and the use of footnotes and endnotes as realisations of annotations are normally stylistic alternatives, which would be relegated to a stylesheet.

== Scope

This document provides a lightweight document metamodel called
_BasicDocument_ for generic documents.
It is intended as an interoperable basis that allows systems to interchange
generic documents while preserving semantics.


The modelling of bibliographies and bibliographic citations is part of the reference model,
but is the subject of a separate document, <<relaton>>,
therefore they are not described in detail in this document.

The following aspects are excluded from scope:

* The specialization and profiling of this model to specialized classes of documents;

* Implementation of the reference model and serialization formats;

* The mapping of the reference model to output formats; and

* Markup schemes and syntaxes that enable creation of documents that fit the reference model.

////
The modelling of changes to documents is in scope of the _BasicDocument_ model described here, but is not described in this document.
